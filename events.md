## Panel: Authorship challenges in big team science

The rise of big team science (Coles et al. 2022) has vitalized conversations about how scientific contributions are recognized and rewarded. This panel will discuss one of the central issues in these conversations: what constitutes authorship in science? Perspectives on this issue vary both within and between individual researchers, scientific organizations, publishers, and science stakeholders. For example, some groups have developed models that distinguish between (a) author vs. non-author contributions, (b) individual vs. group contributions, and so on (Council of Science Editors, 2006). Others have endorsed models that do not make such distinctions—and instead include taxonomies for describing the nature of researchers’ contributions (Allen, Brand, Scott, Altman, & Hlava, 2014; Holcombe, 2019; Moshontz et al., 2018). The goal of this panel is to further this important conversation by bringing together individuals with varied perspectives on the issue.
